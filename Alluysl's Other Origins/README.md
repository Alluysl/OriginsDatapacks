An Origins datapack made to work both in 1.16.5 (tested with Origins 0.7.1, but versions [0.7.3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins/files/3319081) (official) or [0.8.1](https://github.com/Alluysl/origins-fabric/releases/tag/v0.8.1) (unofficial) are recommended) and 1.17/1.17.1 (latest version - [1.0.3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/origins/files/3392228) at the time of writing - recommended) that adds three origins:
- [Chicken](#chicken): an bolder version of the avian that focuses heavily on making use of its slow falling
- [Ostrich](#ostrich): a variant of the avian that sacrifices slow falling for speed
- [Hummingbird](#hummingbird): a sugar-themed origin with creative-like flight, even smaller than the inchling

## Installing

**You don't need to install the datapack** - nor anything else besides Origins/Pehkui and their dependencies - **to join a server that uses it.**

Steps:
- Head to the [versions](versions) and download the one you wish to use. The latest one for the indicated Minecraft version is recommended.
- For singleplayer/LAN, put the datapack in the corresponding folder of your world (`%appdata%/.minecraft/saves/<world name>/datapacks/`). [Here](https://youtu.be/ekFgQsLO5x4)'s how to add datapacks on Aternos.
- Quit and rejoin the world (or restart the server) for the changes to take effects (`/reload` works on paper but I have found it to be extremely unreliable).

Do **not** use `/datapack disable` on this pack, your world will probably freeze.
