# Power Library

A set of powers that are, unless stated otherwise, free to use as long as you don't claim you've made them (a little credit somewhere in the origin/power description if the power is not too trivial (e.g. guardian laser), or a comment in the power if it's simpler, is enough).

Featuring:
- Guardian Laser: a power that allows you to charge up and shoot guardian lasers that hit the first entity. It works on undead mobs and does not go through walls (unless changed). Check out the [associated README](src/Guardian%20Laser/README.md) for more details.
- Guardian Laser Example: an example of how to use the power embedded into a datapack. Check out the [associated README](src/Guardian%20Laser%20Example/README.md) for more details.
- Guardian Laser Example Shell: an example of how to use the power externally to the datapack (requires the Guardian Laser datapack to be loaded too). Check out the [associated README](src/Guardian%20Laser%20Example%20Shell/README.md) for more details.
